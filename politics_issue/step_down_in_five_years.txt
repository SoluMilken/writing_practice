The time limit, five years, given by the statement, is a issue required to be discussed. The time limit should depends on industries. For example, in politic and education, the policies take more time to implement. The changing of leader may break the coherence of policy. However, in technology industry, a fast-paced field, may need innovation continuously, brought by leader. So, the term of office is shorter than other industries.

Limiting leadership roles to a 5 years maximum is not reasonable as the situation in different industry is different, leading to different suitable maximum term of office. National policies and education reform requires long time to implement, thus mandating a 5 year span will result in discontinuities in those policies' implementation. Meanwhile in the tech sector, the on-going innovation will demand new leaders for as new ideas surfaces, thus leading to shorter leader office span.
